#  Replicate Hyper-V VM to Azure using ASR

Now that your Hyper-V host is connected to Azure Site Recovery, it's time to **replicate your virtual machine (VM) to Azure** for disaster recovery.

---

##  Prerequisites

- Hyper-V host is registered with Azure Site Recovery.
- At least one VM running on the Hyper-V host.
- Recovery Services Vault is ready.
- Azure Storage Account is created (for replicated data).

---

##  Step-by-Step: Enable VM Replication

### 1. Go to Azure Portal
- Open your **Recovery Services Vault**.
- In the left menu, click **Replicate**.

### 2. Choose Source Settings
- **Source:** On-Premises
- **Machine Type:** Hyper-V (without System Center)
- **Hyper-V Site:** Select the one you created (e.g., `OnPremHyperVSite`)
- **Hyper-V Host:** Your Windows 11 machine name
- Click **Next**

### 3. Select Virtual Machine
- Azure will list the VMs discovered from your Hyper-V host.
- Select the VM you want to replicate (e.g., `MyVM-WinServer2019`).

### 4. Configure Target Settings
- **Subscription:** Choose your Azure subscription
- **Region:** Select the Azure region (e.g., Central India)
- **Resource Group:** Choose or create one
- **Storage Account:** Select your existing storage account or create new
- **Virtual Network:** Create a test VNet for failover if not already created

### 5. Configure Replication Settings
- **OS Type:** Windows
- **Managed Disks:** Yes (recommended)
- **Replication Policy:** Use default or create a custom policy

> 🔧 You can adjust settings like RPO threshold and recovery point retention here.

### 6. Start Replication
- Review settings and click **Enable Replication**
- Initial replication will begin (can take some time based on VM size)

##  Outcome

Your on-prem Hyper-V VM is now being replicated to Azure. You can monitor the replication status under:

**Recovery Services Vault > Replicated Items**
